# API Deployment  

## Overview  

**The software is delivered to the production environment, and it is made available to end-users**. Technical Writers assist in creating *deployment guides* and *documenting configuration settings, upgrade paths, and rollback procedures*.  

## Associated Documents: Deployment Guide

Deployment Guide are the documents associated to this stage:   

> Instructions on how to install, configure, and deploy the software to the production environment.  
  
## Example  

**An example of a deployment guide** could be a Cloud Deployment Manual for installing the application on AWS, covering steps for server setup, load balancing, and environment configuration.  

**Check the following fictional sample** of a deployment guide of a Web Application on AWS:    

### Web Application Deployment on AWS - Deployment Guide

#### System Information    

> Version: 1.0    
> Target Environment: AWS EC2, S3, RDS       
> Date: October 22, 2024
 
#### Prerequisites  

- [x] AWS account with necessary permissions.
- [x] AWS CLI installed and configured.
- [x] SSH key for EC2 instance access.  

#### Deployment Steps  

##### Step 1 - Set Up EC2 Instance  

1. Log in to AWS Management Console.  
2. Navigate to EC2 Dashboard.  
3. Launch a new instance:    
> * Choose Amazon Linux 2 as the AMI.  
> * Select t2.micro as the instance type.  
> * Configure network settings (assign to the default VPC).  
> * Add storage (minimum 8GB).  
4. Review and launch the instance.  

##### Step 2 - Install Application Dependencies  

1. SSH into the EC2 instance:
   ```
   ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
   ```
2. Update the instance and install necessary packages:
```
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install httpd php php-mysql -y     
```  

##### Step 3 - Deploy the Web Application  

1. Copy your web application files to the EC2 instance:
   ```
   scp -i "your-key.pem" /local/path/to/app/* ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip:/var/www/html/     
   ```
2. Start the Apache server:  

   ```
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   sudo systemctl enable httpd   ```
   
##### Step 4 - Database Configuration (RDS)  

1. Set up an RDS instance (MySQL):  
> * Choose the RDS service in the AWS Console.  
> * Launch a new MySQL instance, configure security groups, and note down the connection endpoint.  

2. Connect your application to the RDS database by updating the applicationâ€™s configuration file with the database connection string.  
  
##### Step 5 - Test and Verify Deployment  

1. Open a browser and navigate to your EC2 instance's public IP.  
2. Ensure the application loads and connects to the database correctly.
