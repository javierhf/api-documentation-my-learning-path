## Development Process    

_TO DO_  

### Planning and Ideation  

!!! info "Goal"  

     Identify business requirements and the purpose of the API.  

**Steps**:    

- Meet with stakeholders to define use cases and gather requirements.  
- Identify the target audience (internal teams, partners, or external developers).  
- Draft initial API requirements, focusing on core features.    

**Deliverables**:    

- High-level API requirements.  
- Use case definitions.

### API Design (OpenAPI Specification)    

!!! info "Goal"  

    Design the API using the OpenAPI specification before any development starts.    

**Steps**:    

- Create an OpenAPI spec (YAML or JSON) to define endpoints, methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`), request parameters,   
and response formats.    
- Collaborate with stakeholders to validate the API contract.  
- Iterate and refine the design based on feedback from consumers.    

**Deliverables**:    

- OpenAPI spec (v1.0) describing all endpoints, data models, and security requirements.  
- Mock server or documentation preview (e.g., using Swagger UI) for consumer feedback.

### API Contract Finalization    

!!! info "Goal"  

    Establish the API contract as a binding agreement between the API provider and consumers.  

**Steps**:  

- Share the OpenAPI spec with consumers for early integration testing.  
- Freeze the API contract once feedback is incorporated.  

**Deliverables**:  

- Finalized API contract with stakeholder approval.  
- Mock server for developers to simulate interactions.

### Development  

!!! info "Goal"  

    Implement the API backend following the agreed API contract.  

**Steps**:  

- Generate server-side code using OpenAPI tools (e.g., Swagger Codegen).  
- Implement business logic and integrate it with data sources.  
- Conduct unit tests to ensure individual components work as expected.  
- Use mock servers for early testing of API consumers.  
  
**Deliverables**:  

- Backend code implementation.  
- Unit test coverage.

### Testing and Quality Assurance  

!!! info "Goal"  

    Ensure the API meets functional and non-functional requirements.  

**Steps**:  

- Perform contract testing to verify the API adheres to the OpenAPI spec.  
- Conduct integration tests with real data and external services.  
- Perform security testing, including authentication and authorization.  
- Conduct performance testing (load, stress, etc.) to verify scalability.  
  
**Deliverables**:  

- Test results (unit, integration, performance, and security).  
- Fixes and optimizations based on test outcomes.  

### Documentation and Developer Experience  

!!! info "Goal"  

    Provide comprehensive and user-friendly API documentation.  

**Steps**:  

- Auto-generate interactive documentation from the OpenAPI spec using tools like **Swagger UI** or **Redoc**.  
- Include examples, usage guides, and response formats.  
- Publish SDKs and client libraries if applicable.  

**Deliverables**:  

- Interactive API documentation.  
- API examples and usage guides.  
- Client SDKs (if applicable).

### Deployment  

!!! info "Goal"  

    Release the API to a production environment.  

**Steps**:  

- Deploy the API to a staging environment for final acceptance testing.  
- Set up monitoring tools to track API performance and availability (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).  
- Deploy the API to production, ensuring rollback strategies are in place.  

**Deliverables**:  

- Production-ready API.  
- Monitoring dashboards.

### Post-Release Monitoring and Maintenance  

!!! info "Goal"  

    Continuously monitor and improve the API after release.  

**Steps**:  

- Monitor API usage, performance, and errors in real-time.  
- Apply patches and fixes to address any issues.  
- Gather feedback from API consumers and prioritize future improvements.  
- Plan for versioning and deprecate old versions as needed.  

**Deliverables**:  

- Logs and performance metrics.  
- Bug fixes and feature enhancements.  
- API versioning strategy.
