# API First  

## Overview  

**The API First approach places the design and specification of an API at the forefront of the development process**. Instead of creating APIs as an afterthought to meet the needs of other parts of an application, the API is treated as a product from the beginning, guiding the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).   

**This ensures that the API is well-thought-out, meets the needs of its consumers, and evolves in a structured manner**. By creating a clear and detailed OpenAPI specification early on, developers and stakeholders can work from a shared understanding, reducing misunderstandings and improving collaboration.

## SDLC and API First  

**The SDLC under the API First approach involves several key phases**:    

1. Planning - where business goals and API requirements are defined  
2. Design- where the API is described using a formal OpenAPI spec  
3. Contract finalization - where the API specification becomes a binding agreement between developers and consumers.   
4. Development - where development proceeds based on this specification, ensuring that the implementation aligns with what has been agreed upon.   
5. Testing - where rigorous testing and quality assurance are performed before the API is deployed and monitored in production.   

**The API is continuously improved post-release**, with an emphasis on maintaining documentation, monitoring performance, and supporting versioning as needed.
