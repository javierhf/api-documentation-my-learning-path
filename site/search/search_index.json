At first, I dreamt of it as a distant and mysterious land, far off. Now, it has become an exciting and achievable area of knowledge and practice.</p> <p>This repository showcases my approach to learning the fundamentals and nuances of API documentation. You'll find various resources, examples, and my personal insights as I explore best practices in documenting APIs.  </p> <p>I\u00a1ll be coding in Python and following the API first approach suggested by the OpenAPI specificiation.</p> <p>I hope this helps you learn about API documentation!  </p>"},{"location":"#goals","title":"Goals","text":"<p>This repository has two main goals.
